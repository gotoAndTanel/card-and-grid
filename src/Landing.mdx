    # Tallink Card & Grid Storybook

    <p>This storybook project was made for Tallink as a homework assignment by Tanel Marran from gotoAndPlay.</p>
    <p>It has two components created based on the requirements outlined in the assignment: a card component and a grid component.</p>

    <p>After a brief email exchange with <a href="mailto:Peeter.Riitmuru@tallink.ee">Peeter.Riitmuru@tallink.ee</a>, some requirements of the assignment were elaborated upon:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The font used in the card component can be set as Arial.</li>
        <li>Pixel-perfect layout is not expected.</li>
        <li>The grid columns have a static width and only resize over breakpoints.</li>
        <li>Since the assigment did not have a guide for colors, using a color-picker is acceptable.</li>
        <li>The homework assignment mentioned the use of a "carousel" component. This was a typo and is to be ignored.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Run <strong>npm run dev</strong> to view the card component being used inside the grid component.</p>
